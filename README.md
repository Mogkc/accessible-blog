# A Forray into Generating Content for the Accessible Internet

This website is a learning project, where I:
- Consider user limitations,
- Apply project management principles and track my time,
- Forray into the world of User eXperience (UX) design,
- Make visible the changes and updates the site undergoes,
- And, of course, talk about everything I'm learning from this project!

Here are some specific things this site is not:
- Interactive. While I am capable of supporting comments and providing a forum, I feel that would be a distraction.
- Static. As I learn, pages will change:
    - Code will be refactored;
    - Features will be added;
    - Early posts on design decisions will grow forward links to where I explain why I changed my mind;
- Complete. There is always more to learn.

This project is not for everyone, not yet. It is my firm belief that something is better than nothing, small improvements are better than no improvements, and learning by reading and doing is better than simply reading. So yes, I'm going to make public a blog about accessibility before I know anything about accessible design, before any features have been implemented, before I have a clear idea of what success will look like.

You can watch me learn.
